# MyProjects
This is the main project im currently working on for Os android.
I am aiming at a revolutionary way of sharing events that supersets the trivialities of social media.
A simple explanation for how the app works is you log in , post an event, and it appears as a blip on the GUI for those who share interests with you.
You set details of the event which will appear when your blip is clicked.
Why Android? Because of the ease of information access and creation provided by its portability and hardware such as accelerometers.
